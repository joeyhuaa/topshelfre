# topshelfre take home assessment - Joey Hua

Hello! My name is Joey Hua and here is my submission for the TopShelfRE coding assignment. I used NodeJS and added full functionality to the API endpoints and testing via Jest and Supertest. I placed the server code into `app.js` (renamed from `NodeJS_.js`, and all tests inside of `app.test.js`.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repo, then run `npm install` in the root directory.
2. Run `node app.js` in terminal to start the server.
3. Run `npx jest` to run tests.

## VSCode Setup
1. Install the VSCode CLI if you haven't yet.
2. Open up terminal in the root directory of this app, then run `code .` to open this project in VSCode. 

## How to run in Docker container
1. Make sure you have Docker CLI installed on your machine.
2. Open up terminal in the root directory of this app, then run `docker compose up --build` to start this app in container.
3. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
